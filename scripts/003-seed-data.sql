-- Insert sample data for testing (optional)
-- This will only work after you have at least one user signed up

-- Note: Replace the UUID below with an actual user ID from your auth.users table
-- You can get this by signing up first, then running: SELECT id FROM auth.users LIMIT 1;

-- Sample project (uncomment and update UUID after first user signup)
/*
INSERT INTO public.projects (id, user_id, name, description) VALUES 
(
  uuid_generate_v4(),
  'YOUR_USER_ID_HERE', -- Replace with actual user ID
  'Sample Project',
  'A sample project to test the v0 clone platform'
);
*/

-- You can add more sample data here after getting real user IDs
